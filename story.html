        <p>
          <strong>Elena "Tilt" Drake</strong> earned her callsign the hard way.
          Her NeuroSync Rejection Syndrome causes crippling vertigo every time
          she translates through a jump gate—but the same condition that made
          her an outsider while growing up also saved her life when neural hacks
          were killing her fellow Vanguard teammates on Forge. Now retired from
          the military and working for Spark, she's dedicated to keeping
          humanity's interests ahead of the AIs that increasingly control the
          galaxy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Her mission sounds straightforward: extract a scientist who has fled a
          research station with vital intelligence. But Sector 36 is anything
          but straightforward. An Omega-class AI governs the system with
          inscrutable motives, speaking in riddles while amassing military
          forces. The jump gate is locked down. Corporations field private
          armies that rival official military strength. And humanity's first
          contact with alien life—the Taurans—ended in a war that left millions
          dead, a colony destroyed, and a fragile truce that no one trusts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As Elena makes her way through a sector in upheaval—displaced
          refugees, disrupted infrastructure, corporate mercenaries, and the
          ever-present sense that something is watching—she discovers that the
          scientist's secret is far more dangerous than anyone anticipated. The
          truth about the Tauran War. The truth about what Ingram is hiding.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The situation spirals into open warfare between military forces and
          corporate paramilitaries, with civilians caught in the crossfire.
          Elena's unique condition and training make her the only hope for the
          millions trapped in a sector that's about to tear itself apart.

From our perspective, they seem god-like. In Sector 36, one such god is amassing a fleet after negotiating a truce with aliens. What is Ingram preparing for?

            Humanity spread across the galaxy, seemingly alone. Then the Taurans arrived with guns blazing and everything changed. No one has ever spoken to one. No one knows what they look like. Rumors spread through the sector like wildfire: they eat people, they wear human skins, they are among us.

            Mega-corporations wield power that rivals governments. They field private armies, own the lives of their employees, and reduce everything to line items on a balance sheet. When Titanforge and Abyssal went to war, millions died before a merger ended the bloodshed—not justice, just economics.
